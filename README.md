# Counting in different number systems

We are usually used to counting in the decimal number system, which uses ten digits: 0 to 9. This is probably because people count on their fingers, and humans usually have ten fingers. However, there are other number systems. Computers, for example, use the binary (binary) number system, which has only two digits: 0 and 1. Programmers also often use the hexadecimal number system, which uses the letters A through F in addition to the digits 0 through 9.

In fact, any number can be represented in any number system, and a program outputs numbers within a certain range in three different number systems: decimal, binary, and hexadecimal. This gives you a better understanding of how numbers can be represented in different number systems and how they relate to each other.

## How to Use

1. Run the program in a compatible environment.
2. Enter a range of numbers to convert.
3. Observe the conversion of numbers into decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representations.
4. Explore the relationships between these different number systems.

## Features

- Convert numbers within a specified range into decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representations.
- Gain insights into how numbers are represented in different number systems.
- Explore the connections between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representations.

## Instructions

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the program's directory.
3. Run the program using `python number_system_converter.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to specify the range of numbers to convert.
5. Observe the conversions and learn about different number systems.

## Sample Output

```
Counting in different number systems

This program shows you equivalent numbers in decimal (base 10),
hexadecimal (base 16), and binary (base 2) numeral systems.    

(Ctrl-C to quit.)
Enter the starting number (e.g. 0) > 0
Enter how many numbers to display (e.g. 1000) > 10
DEC: 0   HEX: 0   BIN: 0
DEC: 1   HEX: 1   BIN: 1
DEC: 2   HEX: 2   BIN: 10
DEC: 3   HEX: 3   BIN: 11
DEC: 4   HEX: 4   BIN: 100
DEC: 5   HEX: 5   BIN: 101
DEC: 6   HEX: 6   BIN: 110
DEC: 7   HEX: 7   BIN: 111
DEC: 8   HEX: 8   BIN: 1000
DEC: 9   HEX: 9   BIN: 1001
