# Counting in different number systems

We are usually used to counting in the decimal number system, which uses ten digits: 0 to 9. This is probably because people count on their fingers, and humans usually have ten fingers. However, there are other number systems. Computers, for example, use the binary (binary) number system, which has only two digits: 0 and 1. Programmers also often use the hexadecimal number system, which uses the letters A through F in addition to the digits 0 through 9.

In fact, any number can be represented in any number system, and a program outputs numbers within a certain range in three different number systems: decimal, binary, and hexadecimal. This gives you a better understanding of how numbers can be represented in different number systems and how they relate to each other.

## How to Use

1. Run the program in a compatible environment.
2. Enter a range of numbers to convert.
3. Observe the conversion of numbers into decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representations.
4. Explore the relationships between these different number systems.
